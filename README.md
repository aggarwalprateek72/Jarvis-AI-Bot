It is a python based AI Assistant which can do simple functions like:
  1. Open Google
  2. Search on Wikipedia
  3. Open Youtube
  4. Play Music
  5. Send Email(from and to specific user for now)
  6. Open VS Code

Further changes can be made to the assistant as adding more dynamic features, adding a UI(similar or better than Iron Man's Jarvis), adding new voices, self recognizing speaker as Male or female etc.
